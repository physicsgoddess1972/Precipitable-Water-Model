name: CirrusTest
tagline: New and Improved PMAT
released: yes
date: 3/6/2021
version: 2.0
changes:
  overall:
    - updated: Compatible with R 4.0
  data-input:
    - added: Now includes relative humidity imports.
    - added: Now pulls data from MesoWest
    - added: New guidelines for sensors that are not active (See Documentation Page for further info.)
  setup-script:
    - updated: Now installs R 4.0
    - added: Additional argument to configure database imports (run `bash setup.sh -h` for more information)
  plots:
    - fixed: Fixed issues with bar charts where if there were more than three sensors, not all bar charts would be added for the remaining sensors.
    - added: Added more time series plots and more composite plots.
    - updated: Changed the x-axis labeling system to have tick marks at the 1st of the month.
    - updated: Redesigned the main analytical plot, confidence interval is now a shaded region, and the plot is now monochromatic.

    - updated: Pac-man residual now resides in a new plot set (run `Rscript model.r --pacman`)
    - added: Mean TPW and Mean temperature comparison can now be visualized in a Pac-Man plot.
  web-applications:
    - added: Two web-apps are active. One is a Data Dashboard, which allows for the viewing of time series data as a scatter plot or a heat map, and analytical comparisons between data that has been collected.
    - added: The Data Dashboard also allows for custom time series data to be uploaded.
    - added:  The Machine Learning dashboard now allows for custom data to be uploaded.
