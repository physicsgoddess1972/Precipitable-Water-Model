    released: yes
    date: 3/6/2021
    changes:
      overall:
        - updated: Compatible with R 4.0
      data-input:
        - added: Now includes relative humidity imports
        - added: Now pulls data from MesoWest
        - added: New guidelines for sensors that are not active (See Documentation Page for further info.)
      setup-script:
        - updated: Now installs R 4.0
        - added: Additional argument to configure database imports (run `bash setup.sh -h` for more information)
      plots:
        - fixed: Fixed issues with bar charts where if there were more than three sensors, not all bar charts would be added for the remaining sensors.
        - added: Added more time series plots and more composite plots.
        - updated: Changed the x-axis labeling system to have tick marks at the 1st of the month.
        - updated: Redesigned the main analytical plot, confidence interval is now a shaded region, and the plot is now monochromatic.
        - updated: Pac-Man residual was removed from this plot set
        - updated: Pac-man residual now resides in a new plot set (run `Rscript model.r --pacman`)
        - added: Mean TPW and Mean temperature comparison can now be visualized in a Pac-Man plot.
      web-applications:
        - added: Two web-apps are active. One is a Data Dashboard, which allows for the viewing of time series data as a scatter plot or a heat map, and analytical comparisons between data that has been collected.
        - added: The Data Dashboard also allows for custom time series data to be uploaded.
        - added:  The Machine Learning dashboard now allows for custom data to be uploaded.
      documentation:
        - fixed: Fixed multiple CSS issues
        - updated: Altered Pac-Man residual plot documentation to refer to the package documentation
        - updated: Updated procedure to include the new command-line arguments
        - added: Included buttons on the dashboard's "Project Updates" card to include Pac-Man plots and Poster plots that are generated from data we have collected.
        - updated: We also scored a `.tech` domain for the page
      automation:
        - misc: This is a work in progress
