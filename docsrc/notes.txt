Using pattern identification, the data format is flexible with few strict requirements.
Here are some examples of valid datasets:
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/physicsgoddess1972/Precipitable-Water-Model/blob/master/data/example/example1.csv" target="_blank">Dataset 1</a>
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/physicsgoddess1972/Precipitable-Water-Model/blob/master/data/example/example2.csv" target="_blank">Dataset 2</a>
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/physicsgoddess1972/Precipitable-Water-Model/blob/master/data/example/example1.csv" target="_blank">Dataset 3</a>
<br /><br />
It should be noted that the columns do not have to be in any set order, with one small caveat, the model pulls the data from columns with headers containing specific words or phrases. The caveat is with regards to Ground and Sky temperature readings. The temperature measurements must go in consecutive order by sensor as determined by <code>instruments.yml</code>.
<br /><br />
For example, if the order of the sensors in <code>instruments.yml</code> is 1610 TE, FLIR i3, and then AMES 1. Then the order of the ground and sky temperature measurements in the dataset should be: 1610 TE, FLIR i3, and then AMES 1. <i>(As seen in Dataset 2)</i>
<h3>Column Headers for Dataset</h3>

			<td>Date</td>
			<td><code>MM/DD/YYYY</code></td>

			<td><b>Time</b></td>
			<td>Time</td>

			<td>Condition</td>
			<td>clear sky / overcast</td>

		<tr>
			<td><b>Sky Temperature</b></td>

			<td>Number</td>

			<td><b>Ground Temperature</b></td>
			<td>Sensor Name<sup>\*</sup> (Ground)</td>
			<td>Number</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<sup>\*</sup>This should be consistent with what the sensor is labeled as in <code>instruments.yml</code>
<h3>Format of <code>instruments.yml</code></h3>
The purpose of this file is to get all of the information on the sensors organized in one place. This file has a total
of six fields for each sensor. The format will look like the following snippet. Additional sensors can be added by creating a new set of fields underneath the existing information. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/physicsgoddess1972/Precipitable-Water-Model/pmat-socorro-nm/data/instruments.yml">here is an example</a>.
<pre>
<code>
- sensor:
    name:
    error:
    color:
    ratio:
    poster:
    range:
</code>
</pre>

<li>The first entry is used for designating the Sensor. If there is more than one sensor of the same type than use a underbar and the number. For example, if there are two sensors called AMES, then the you would type in `AMES_1` and `AMES_2`. </li>

<li>The second entry is the error of the sensor in units of Celsius. If an error cannot be recorded use `null`. </li>

<li>The third entry is the color code, this is a hexidecimal color that will be used in sensor specific plots. An example is of an input is `FF00FF`. </li>
<li>The fourth entry is the Distance ratio of the sensor, this is often recorded in the manual or on the packaging. In the file record the ratio in the format `a to b` with `a` and `b` corresponding to the numbers for the sensor.</li>
<li>The fifth entry is a `true` or `false` input that will decide whether or not to include the sensor in the poster plots</li>
<li>The last entry is for the temperature range in Celsius. This will look something like `a ~ b` with `a` representative of the lowest temperature and `b` being the larger temperature</li>
<h3>Important Note for Missing Data</h3>
If you have a sensor that did not take measurements for a period of time, for whatever reason, use `-Inf` as the measurement for that day. For example, if the battery of AMES 1 died for two days the ground and sky measurement for those days would be `-Inf`.
