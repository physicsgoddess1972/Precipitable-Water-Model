## How to deploy this god-awful evil

### GitHub (Cloud)
1. Create a GitHub repository from the [Offical Template](https://template.pmat.app).
2. Edit the README page based on your information

Refer to the **Data Collection** chapter to complete the remaining steps.
3. Update the `_pmat.yml` configuration file with the appropriate information for your sensors and location
4. Update the `cool_data.csv` data file with your raw data. 

Once you push the `cool_data.csv` file to the GitHub repository, the software will begin automatically. You will be able to see the progress of the algorithm by visiting the **Actions** tab on the repository page. 

### Linux (Ubuntu and Debian)
