## This is a draft
# Summary

The Precipitable-water Model Analysis Tool (PMAT) utilizes four distinct modules to operate: Deployment, Data Import, Data Analysis, and the Classical Support Vector Machine module. Together the four modules can pre-process data collected in the field and aggregate with selected atmospheric science databases, then process the data, conduct primary analysis functions, and then visualize the results [@pmat].

# Statement of Need
PMAT has been developed to address our own need for an analysis tool for studying the relationship between zenith sky temperature and total precipitable water.
